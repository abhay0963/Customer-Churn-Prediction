# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction

A beginner-friendly, end-to-end **Machine Learning project** that predicts whether a telecom customer is likely to churn (leave the service), built as an **MCA Machine Learning Assignment**.

The project covers the full ML workflow — data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, model training, evaluation, and deployment through an interactive **Streamlit** web app.

## 📖 Introduction

Customer churn occurs when a customer stops using a company's product or service. For telecom companies, retaining existing customers is far cheaper than acquiring new ones, which makes **predicting churn in advance** extremely valuable.

This project uses the **Telco Customer Churn dataset** to train Machine Learning models that predict churn based on customer demographics, account information, and subscribed services. The final model is deployed through a clean, interactive Streamlit web application.

> ⚠️ This is an academic project built for an MCA Machine Learning course. It intentionally uses simple, well-understood techniques rather than advanced/production-grade tooling, to keep the project easy to explain and defend in a viva.

## ⚙️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abhay0963/Customer-Churn-Prediction.git
cd Customer-Churn-Prediction
```

2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended)**

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ▶️ Running the App

**Step 1 — Train the model (only needed once, or after changing the dataset)**

```bash
cd src
python train_model.py
```

This generates `churn_model.pkl`, `scaler.pkl`, `feature_names.json`, `model_results.csv`, and the evaluation plots inside the `models/` folder.

**Step 2 — Launch the Streamlit app**

```bash
streamlit run src/app.py
```

The app will open automatically in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## 📈 Results

Two models were trained and compared on the same train/test split:

| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Logistic Regression** ✅ | **80.62%** | 65.26% | 57.75% | 61.28% |
| Random Forest | 78.99% | – | – | – |

**Logistic Regression** was selected as the final model since it achieved the highest accuracy while remaining simple and easy to interpret — a good fit for this project's goals.

## 🚀 Future Scope

- Add more ML models (e.g., Support Vector Machines, Gradient Boosting)
- Hyperparameter tuning for further performance improvements
- Deploy the app on Streamlit Community Cloud
- Add customer segmentation and retention strategy suggestions
- Extend into an advanced Capstone Project featuring Agentic AI, RAG, LangGraph, MCP, FastAPI, Vector Databases, Docker, and Cloud deployment (planned as a separate, future project)
